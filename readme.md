CIMpleHostedForms is a simple Javascript library designed to make embedding Authorize.net's [CIM hosted form](http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference/starting_guide.html#custInfoManager-hosted) easy.

Authorize.Net [provides sample code](http://developer.authorize.net/downloads/samplecode/) for displaying the hosted form in a pre-styled modal popup. CIMpleHostedForms makes it simple to embed the hosted form iframe anywhere on a page, not just a modal.
